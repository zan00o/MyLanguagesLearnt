Fuck you mean?
Young Gunna Wunna back, callin' me splurge
Watch me jump right off the curb (eeeyah)
Bentley Spur fly like a bird
Spin on the first and the third (eeeyah)
Solid, I'm keepin' my word
Can't be my equal, I don't know what you heard (eeeyah)
Crank up the foreign, I swerve
Keep me a stick if they purge (eeeyah)
Ha, ha (eeeyah)

In my own lane, we can't merge (eeeyah)
Suck with no hands, you can learn (eeeyah)
