I only talk to God when I need a favor
And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So, who the hell am I, who the hell am I
To expect a Savior, oh
If I only talk to God when I need a favor?
But God, I need a favor
I know Amazing Grace, but I ain't been livin' them words
Swear I spend most Sundays, drunk off my ass, than I have in church
Hard cover King James only been savin' dust on the nightstand
And I don't know what to say by the time I fold my hands
I only talk to God when I need a favor
And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So, who the hell am I, who the hell am I
To expect a Savior, oh
If I only talk to God when I need a favor?
But God, I need a favor
Amen, amen
Yeah, I owe you more than one and beggars can't be choosers
But I'll pay for all I've done, just please don't let me lose her
I only talk to God when I need a favor
And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So, who the hell am I, who the hell am I
To expect a Savior, oh
If I only talk to God when I need a favor?
But God, I need a favor
Amen, amen
Amen, amen
Hangin' in there, just barely
Throwin' up prayers, like Hail Mary's
If You're still there, Lord, spare me
Oh my God, oh my God, Hail Mary
Hangin' in there, just barely
Throwin' up prayers, like Hail Mary's
If You're still there, Lord, spare me
Oh my God, oh my God, Hail Mary
I only talk to God when I need a favor
And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So tell me, who the hell am I to expect a Savior
When I only talk to God if I need a favor?
God, I need a favor
Amen
God, I need a favor, woah
Amen
