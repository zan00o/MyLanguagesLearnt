The truth is bulletproof, there’s no fooling you
I don’t dress the same
Me and who you say I was yesterday
Have gone our separate ways

Left my living fast somewhere in the past
‘Cause that’s for chasing cars
Turns out open bars lead to broken hearts
And going way too far

I know I used to be crazy
I know I used to be fun
You say I used to be wild
I say I used to be young

You tell me time has done changed me
That’s fine, I’ve had a good run
I know I used to be crazy
That’s ’cause I used to be young

Take one, pour it out
It’s not worth crying ’bout the things you can’t erase
Like tattoos and regrets
Words I never meant and ones that got away

Left my living fast somewhere in the past
And took another road
Turns out crowded rooms, empty out as soon
There’s somewhere else to go, oh

I know I used to be crazy
I know I used to be fun
You say I used to be wild
I say I used to be young

You tell me time has done changed me
That’s fine, I’ve had a good run
I know I used to be crazy
That’s ’cause I used to be young

Ohh, ohh
Ohh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh
Yeah
Whoa, whoa
Ohh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh

I know I used to be crazy
Messed up, but, God, was it fun
I know I used to be wild
That’s ’cause I used to be young

Those wasted nights are not wasted
I remember everyone
I know I used to be crazy
That’s ’cause I used to be young

You tell me time has done changed me
That’s fine, I’ve had a good run
I know I used to be crazy
That’s ’cause I used to be young
